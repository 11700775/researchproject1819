# Research Project #
In this repository, you'll find all the information to get started with the Research Project for AI & Robotics. 

## Contents ##
Folder 'webots' contains some default environments to test your project. New environments will be added soon.

## Quick Guide: Combining ROS & WeBots ##
0. Install Ubuntu (we use 18.04 LTS) in dual boot (recommended) or in VM
1. Install ROS (Melodic)
2. Install WeBots
3. Create WeBots world (or load a world that is provided in this repository)
4. Make sure to properly install all examples, sample code & provided srv/msg files : 
    > [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-7-using-ros](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-7-using-ros)
5. Put ROS controller on robot in WeBots
	  > This controller ships with WeBots and is written in C++, but we won't be editing this
6. Use rospy to create a node. Try some services that are available on the WeBots ROS controller on the robot
    > ROS will be covered extensively in the AI & Robotics course
7. Later on in the project, we will host some workshops to do more complex actions in WeBots. (create own world, own robots, ...)
